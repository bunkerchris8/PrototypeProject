Up to date status: trying to get it to track the sun. The mirror has a 180 degree movement pattern to work with. We have access to real time. The easiest way to do this is have tables with lots of information. Monthly sunrise and sunset is a must to capture seasonal patterns.

There will be four different settings that will be activated by a dial (think if then). South facing is the easiest to capture because it literally just goes to left to right. East and west and more difficult. North, I dont even know if there is much you can do.
