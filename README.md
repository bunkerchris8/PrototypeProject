4.23.25
Check out simulatednotes4.23.25.txt this code works except the motor moves 360 degrees instead of 180 to track the sun
Currently focusing on southern facing windows because it is easiest
Most up to date executable file doesnt move the motor but produces output on serial monitor. This problem occurred because I switched frorm Stepper Library to AccelStepper Library which is supposed to be able to handle the motor more precisely.
